    Summary: 
        began logging, summary of work to current point
    Current Status: 
        Have generalized function to go get POI's from google maps with place paramaters and search distance.
    Concerns: 
        Current data seems to be a lil funky, not exact enough. 
    Next Steps: 
        Add more data from google maps:
            - parks
            - bus stops
            - ...

    Summary: 
        1. did some testing to see what is coming back from our nearby poi search:
            - It was looking at everything in a 5km radius, changed to 1km seems more appropriate
            - While at a 5km radius, it didn't list the 5 closest businesses to origin point, so something is wrong there
        2. I refactored to separate the get-nearby from get-closest
            - likely at this point 
    Current Status: Refactored some, mostly same point
    todo: 
        [x] check incoming data 
        [] separate concerns
        [] store data
